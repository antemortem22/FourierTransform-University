The purpose of this script was given by an universitary paper to explain the Fourier Transform in a simple and understandable way.
This code can graph an equation loaded by hand or one uploaded from the files of your computer, which corresponds to the characteristics of the Fourier Transform. 
If you know the theory of this concept, you can see a graph of all the aspects that are contemplated in this theorem, its real part, imaginary, its complex plane, polar, etc. 
Althought it's a very intuitive interface, it shows error messages box if you do something wrong.
You can also save the equations and graphs that were made on your computer.
